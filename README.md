> Easy conditional if-else logic for your Cypress tests

Tested with `cy.get`, `cy.contains`, `cy.find`, `.then`, `.within` commands

## Install

Add this package as a dev dependency

```
$ npm i -D cypress-if
# or using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-if
```

Include this package in your spec or support file

```js
import 'cypress-if'
```

Types for the `.if()` and `.else()` commands are described in the [src/index.d.ts](./src/index.d.ts) file.

## Use

Let's say, there is a dialog that might sometimes be visible when you visit the page. You can close it by finding it using the [cy.get](https://on.cypress.io/get) command follows by the `.if()` command. If the dialog really exists, then all commands chained after `.if()` run. If the dialog is not found, then the rest of the chain is skipped.

```js
cy.get('dialog#survey').if().contains('button', 'Close').click()
```

## Assertions

By default, the `.if()` command just checks the existence of the element returned by the `cy.get` command. You might use instead a different assertion, like close a dialog if it is visible:

```js
cy.get('dialog#survey').if('visible').contains('button', 'Close').click()
```

If the dialog was invisible, the visibility assertion fails, and the rest of the commands was skipped

You can use assertions with arguments

```js
cy.wrap(42).if('equal', 42)...
```

You can use assertions with `not`

```js
cy.get('#enrolled').if('not.checked').check()
```

## else command

You can chain `.else()` command that is only executed if the `.if()` is skipped.

```js
cy.contains('Accept cookies')
  .if('visible')
  .click()
  .else()
  .log('no cookie banner')
```

The subject from the `.if()` command will be passed to the `.else()` chain, this allows you to work with the original element:

```js
cy.get('#enrolled')
  .if('checked')
  .log('**already enrolled**')
  // the checkbox should be passed into .else()
  .else()
  .check()
```

## Multiple commands

Sometimes it makes sense to place the "if" or "else" commands into `.then()` block

```js
cy.get('#survey')
  .if('visible')
  .then(() => {
    cy.log('closing the survey')
    cy.contains('button', 'Close').click()
  })
  .else()
  .then(() => {
    cy.log('Already closed')
  })
```

## Within

You can attach `.within()` command to the `.if()`

```js
cy.get('#survey')
  .if('visible')
  .within(() => {
    // fill the survey
    // click the submit button
  })
```

## finally

You might want to finish if/else command chains and continue afterwards. This is the purpose for the `.finally()` child command:

```js
cy.get('#agreed')
  .if('not.checked')
  .check()
  .else()
  .log('already checked')
  .finally()
  .should('be.checked')
```

## Debugging

This module uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme) module to output verbose browser console messages when needed. To turn the logging on, open the browser's DevTools console and set the local storage entry:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'cypress-if'
```

If you re-run the tests, you should see the messages appear in the console
