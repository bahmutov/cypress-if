## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

In general, Cypress team considers [conditional testing an anti-pattern](https://on.cypress.io/conditional-testing). Thus `cypress-if` should be used only if the test really cannot deterministically execute its steps. You can also read my [conditional testing](https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/recipes/conditional-testing.html) examples.

## No xpath support

This plugin works by overriding `cy.get`, `cy.find`, and some other Cypress commands. It does NOT override the [cy.xpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/xpath) commands that comes from another plugin. I personally suggest never using `xpath` selectors (and I wrote `cy.xpath`), the jQuery selectors included with Cypress are much more powerful and less prone to breaking. Learn them using [cypress-examples](https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples).

## Install

Add this package as a dev dependency

```
$ npm i -D cypress-if
# or using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-if
```

Include this package in your spec or support file

```js
import 'cypress-if'
```

### Types

Types for the `.if()` and `.else()` commands are described in the include typescript file [src/index.d.ts](./src/index.d.ts) file. If you need intellisense, include the type for this package. For example,

```js
// your spec file
/// <reference types="cypress-if" />
```

If it does not work, and TS still complains about unknown command `.if`, then do the following trick and move on:

```js
cy.get(...)
  // @ts-ignore
  .if()
```

## Use

Let's say, there is a dialog that might sometimes be visible when you visit the page. You can close it by finding it using the [cy.get](https://on.cypress.io/get) command follows by the `.if()` command. If the dialog really exists, then all commands chained after `.if()` run. If the dialog is not found, then the rest of the chain is skipped.

```js
cy.get('dialog#survey').if().contains('button', 'Close').click()
```

![Dialog was open](./img/dialog-open.gif)

## Assertions

By default, the `.if()` command just checks the existence of the element returned by the `cy.get` command. You might use instead a different assertion, like close a dialog if it is visible:

```js
cy.get('dialog#survey').if('visible').contains('button', 'Close').click()
```

If the dialog was invisible, the visibility assertion fails, and the rest of the commands was skipped

![Dialog was closed](./img/dialog-closed.png)

You can use assertions with arguments

```js
cy.wrap(42).if('equal', 42)...
```

You can use assertions with `not`

```js
cy.get('#enrolled').if('not.checked').check()
```

### Callback function

You can check the value yourself by writing a callback function, similar to the [should(callback)](http://on.cypress.io/should#Function) and its [many examples](https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/commands/assertions.html). You can use predicate and Chai assertions, but you **cannot use any Cypress commands inside the callback**, since it only synchronously checks the given value.

```js
// predicate function returning a boolean
const isEven = (n) => n % 2 === 0
cy.wrap(42).if(isEven).log('even').else().log('odd')
// a function using Chai assertions
const is42 = (n) => expect(n).to.equal(42)
cy.wrap(42).if(is42).log('42!').else().log('some other number')
```

For more examples, see the [cypress/e2e/callback.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/callback.cy.js) spec

### Combining assertions

If you want to right complex assertions that combine other checks using AND, OR connectors, please use a callback function.

```js
// AND predicate using &&
cy.wrap(42).if((n) => n > 20 && n < 50)
// AND connector using Chai "and" connector
cy.wrap(42).if((n) => expect(n).to.be.greaterThan(20).and.to.be.lessThan(50))
// OR predicate using ||
cy.wrap(42).if((n) => n > 20 || n < 10)
```

Unfortunately, there is no Chai OR connector.

For more examples, see the [cypress/e2e/and-or.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/and-or.cy.js) spec file

## else command

You can chain `.else()` command that is only executed if the `.if()` is skipped.

```js
cy.contains('Accept cookies')
  .if('visible')
  .click()
  .else()
  .log('no cookie banner')
```

The subject from the `.if()` command will be passed to the `.else()` chain, this allows you to work with the original element:

```js
cy.get('#enrolled')
  .if('checked')
  .log('**already enrolled**')
  // the checkbox should be passed into .else()
  .else()
  .check()
```

You can print a message if the `ELSE` branch is taken

```js
cy.get('...').if('...').else().log('a message')
// same as
cy.get('...').if('...').else('a message')
```

## Multiple commands

Sometimes it makes sense to place the "if" or "else" commands into `.then()` block

```js
cy.get('#survey')
  .if('visible')
  .then(() => {
    cy.log('closing the survey')
    cy.contains('button', 'Close').click()
  })
  .else()
  .then(() => {
    cy.log('Already closed')
  })
```

## Within

You can attach `.within()` command to the `.if()`

```js
cy.get('#survey')
  .if('visible')
  .within(() => {
    // fill the survey
    // click the submit button
  })
```

## finally

You might want to finish if/else command chains and continue afterwards. This is the purpose for the `.finally()` child command:

```js
cy.get('#agreed')
  .if('not.checked')
  .check()
  .else()
  .log('already checked')
  .finally()
  .should('be.checked')
```

`.finally` comes in useful when you are chaining something and don't want the "if/else" to "leak" to the next series of commands. From [#59](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-if/issues/59) comes the [issue-59.cy.js](./github/../cypress/e2e/issue-59.cy.js)

```js
function bar() {
  return (
    cy
      .wrap('testing')
      .if()
      .then(() => cy.wrap('got it'))
      .else()
      .then(() => cy.wrap('else do'))
      // to correctly STOP the chaining if/else
      // from putting anything chained of bar()
      // need to add .finally() command
      .finally()
  )
}
bar().then((it) => {
  cy.log(`result: ${it}`)
})
// logs:
// "testing"
// "got it"
// result: got it"
```

## cy.task

You can perform commands if the `cy.task` failed

```js
cy.task('throws').if('failed')
// handle the failure
```

## Aliases

You can have conditional commands depending on an alias that might exist.

```js
cy.get('@maybe')
  .if()
  // commands to execute if the alias "maybe" exists
  .else()
  // commands to execute if the alias "maybe" does not exist
  .finally()
  // commands to execute after
  .log(...)
```

See spec [alias.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/alias.cy.js)

## Null values

Typically `null` values are treated same as `undefined` and follow the "else" path. You can specifically check for `null` and `not.null` using these assertions:

```js
cy.wrap(null).if('null') // takes IF path
cy.wrap(null).if('not.null') // takes ELSE path
cy.wrap(42).if('not.null') // takes IF path
```

See spec [null.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/null.cy.js)

## raise

This plugin includes a utility custom command `cy.raise` that lets you conveniently throw an error.

```js
cy.get('li').if('not.have.length', 3).raise('Wrong number of todos')
```

**Tip:** the above syntax works, but you better pass an Error instance rather than a string to get the exact stack trace location

```js
cy.get('li').if('not.have.length', 3).raise(new Error('Wrong number of todos'))
```

## More examples

Check out the spec files in [cypress/e2e](./cypress/e2e/) folder. If you still have a question, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-if/issues).

## Debugging

This module uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme) module to output verbose browser console messages when needed. To turn the logging on, open the browser's DevTools console and set the local storage entry:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'cypress-if'
```

If you re-run the tests, you should see the messages appear in the console
